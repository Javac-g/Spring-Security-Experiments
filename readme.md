# Spring Security Approaches - Testing and Implementation

This repository is dedicated to testing various security approaches in Spring Security. The goal is to explore modern and legacy security configurations, and understand their best-use cases.

## Security Approaches and Their Status

Below is a table summarizing the various security approaches in Spring Security, their current status, when you should learn them, and the corresponding versions of Spring, Spring Security, Java, and Spring Boot.

| Approach                          | Status      | When to Learn?                                    | Spring Version      | Spring Security Version | Java Version | Spring Boot Version |
|-----------------------------------|-------------|---------------------------------------------------|---------------------|-------------------------|--------------|---------------------|
| **XML-Based Security (security.xml)** | ❌ Deprecated | Ignore unless maintaining legacy projects         | Spring 4.x and below | Spring Security 4.x and below | Java 7-8     | Spring Boot 1.x     |
| **WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter**   | ❌ Deprecated | Avoid for new projects                           | Spring 5.x           | Spring Security 5.x      | Java 8+      | Spring Boot 2.x     |
| **SecurityFilterChain (Non-Lambda)**| ✅ Modern    | Learn if working with Spring Security 5+         | Spring 5.x+          | Spring Security 5.x+     | Java 8+      | Spring Boot 2.x+    |
| **Lambda-Based SecurityFilterChain**| ✅ Best Practice | Use this for all new projects                   | Spring 5.x+          | Spring Security 5.x+     | Java 8+      | Spring Boot 2.x+    |
| **Method-Level Security (@PreAuthorize)** | ✅ Recommended | Very useful for securing business logic         | Spring 4.x+          | Spring Security 5.x+     | Java 8+      | Spring Boot 2.x+    |
| **LDAP Authentication**           | ✅ Enterprise | Learn only if working with Active Directory/LDAP | Spring 4.x+          | Spring Security 5.x+     | Java 8+      | Spring Boot 2.x+    |
| **OAuth2 & JWT (API Security)**    | ✅ Essential for APIs | Learn if working with REST APIs                  | Spring 5.x+          | Spring Security 5.x+     | Java 8+      | Spring Boot 2.x+    |

## Learning Plan

This repository provides hands-on examples and tests for each of the above approaches. Below is a suggested approach on when and why you should learn each of these methods:

1. **XML-Based Security (security.xml)**
   - **Status**: Deprecated
   - **Recommendation**: Avoid using XML-based configuration for new projects. This is typically seen in legacy projects. It is not a recommended approach for modern Spring Security setups.
   - **Spring Version**: Spring 4.x and below
   - **Spring Security Version**: Spring Security 4.x and below
   - **Java Version**: Java 7-8
   - **Spring Boot Version**: Spring Boot 1.x

2. **WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter**
   - **Status**: Deprecated
   - **Recommendation**: Avoid using `WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter` for new projects, as it has been replaced by more modern configurations. It may be useful for transitioning legacy projects to newer versions of Spring Security.
   - **Spring Version**: Spring 5.x
   - **Spring Security Version**: Spring Security 5.x
   - **Java Version**: Java 8+
   - **Spring Boot Version**: Spring Boot 2.x

3. **SecurityFilterChain (Non-Lambda)**
   - **Status**: Modern
   - **Recommendation**: Learn this if you're working with Spring Security 5+. This approach is still viable but less flexible than the lambda-based approach.
   - **Spring Version**: Spring 5.x+
   - **Spring Security Version**: Spring Security 5.x+
   - **Java Version**: Java 8+
   - **Spring Boot Version**: Spring Boot 2.x+

4. **Lambda-Based SecurityFilterChain**
   - **Status**: Best Practice
   - **Recommendation**: This is the recommended approach for all new Spring Security projects. It’s modern, flexible, and aligns with best practices in the Spring ecosystem.
   - **Spring Version**: Spring 5.x+
   - **Spring Security Version**: Spring Security 5.x+
   - **Java Version**: Java 8+
   - **Spring Boot Version**: Spring Boot 2.x+

5. **Method-Level Security (@PreAuthorize)**
   - **Status**: Recommended
   - **Recommendation**: Highly useful for securing business logic at the method level. Use this if you need more fine-grained control over who can access specific methods.
   - **Spring Version**: Spring 4.x+
   - **Spring Security Version**: Spring Security 5.x+
   - **Java Version**: Java 8+
   - **Spring Boot Version**: Spring Boot 2.x+

6. **LDAP Authentication**
   - **Status**: Enterprise
   - **Recommendation**: Learn this if you are working with systems that require Active Directory or LDAP for authentication. This is a specialized use case for enterprise-level projects.
   - **Spring Version**: Spring 4.x+
   - **Spring Security Version**: Spring Security 5.x+
   - **Java Version**: Java 8+
   - **Spring Boot Version**: Spring Boot 2.x+

7. **OAuth2 & JWT (API Security)**
   - **Status**: Essential for APIs
   - **Recommendation**: Learn OAuth2 and JWT if you are working with REST APIs. These are essential for securing APIs and implementing authentication and authorization for modern web and mobile applications.
   - **Spring Version**: Spring 5.x+
   - **Spring Security Version**: Spring Security 5.x+
   - **Java Version**: Java 8+
   - **Spring Boot Version**: Spring Boot 2.x+
